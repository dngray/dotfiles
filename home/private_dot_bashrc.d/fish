## Start fish shell for my terminals
## We can use `lchsh` to change the shell, however, because fish cannot read
## shell files it will also disable loading of /etc/profile and what is worse
## even /etc/profile.d/. Thanks to that we are missing a lot of environment
## variables like XDG_DATA_DIR injected by Flatpaks to get the Flatpak Desktop
## files.

## This is a workaround to have fish in terminal but not for the system
## loading.
